Windows app to allow bulk sending of emails via an uploading Excel file via Mandrill


My company EngageMore needed a way for some of our admin users to send email to a bulk
of users without using an email service such as Mail Chimp or Constant Contas. Using Mandrill(affiliate of MailChimp) allows us to use their robust api to send the emails via code with some advanced tracking.  I whipped up this app really quick. Feel free to contribute.
